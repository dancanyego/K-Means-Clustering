# K-Means-Clustering 
Welcome to the K-Means Clustering repository! In this project, we explore the fundamentals of K-Means Clustering, a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for grouping data into clusters. This README.md file serves as a guide to understanding the concept and implementation of K-Means Clustering.

## What is K-Means Clustering?

K-Means Clustering is a simple and efficient algorithm that aims to partition a given dataset into K distinct non-overlapping clusters. Each data point is assigned to one of the K clusters based on its proximity to the cluster's centroid. The algorithm works iteratively to optimize the positions of the centroids, aiming to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) or the average distance between data points and their respective centroids.

## How does K-Means Clustering work?

1. **Step 1: Initialization**

   - Select the number of clusters, K, that you want the algorithm to identify.
   - Randomly initialize the K centroids. These centroids can be any data point from the dataset or selected randomly within the range of the dataset.

2. **Step 2: Assigning Data Points to Clusters**

   - For each data point, calculate the distance to each centroid.
   - Assign the data point to the cluster with the closest centroid.

3. **Step 3: Updating Centroid Positions**

   - After all data points have been assigned to clusters, calculate the new centroid positions.
   - The new position of a centroid is determined by taking the mean of all data points assigned to that centroid.

4. **Step 4: Repeat Steps 2 and 3**

   - Repeat Steps 2 and 3 until convergence is reached. Convergence occurs when the centroids no longer move significantly or when a maximum number of iterations is reached.

5. **Step 5: Output**

   - The algorithm outputs the final cluster assignments and the positions of the centroids.

## Getting Started

To run the K-Means Clustering algorithm on your own dataset, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies. You can use the following command:

3. Prepare your dataset.

   - Ensure that your dataset is in a suitable format (e.g., a CSV file).
   - If necessary, preprocess your dataset by normalizing or scaling the features.

4. Open the `K-Means Sample project.ipynb` file.

   - Customize the algorithm parameters, such as the number of clusters (K) and the maximum number of iterations.
   - Update the file path and any data preprocessing steps specific to your dataset.

5. Run the script.

6. View the results.

   - The algorithm will output the cluster assignments for each data point and the final positions of the centroids.
   - You can visualize the results using appropriate plots or analyze the clusters further as needed.
